"""VideoAnnotator Industry Standards Schemas.

This module has been migrated to use native formats via src.exporters.native_formats.
Most functionality has been moved to direct integration with:
- pycocotools (COCO format)
- webvtt-py (WebVTT format)
- pyannote.core (RTTM format)
- praatio (TextGrid format)

This file is preserved for compatibility but most imports have been disabled.
