"""Unit tests for v1.3.0 database migrations.

Tests migration from v1.2.x to v1.3.0 schema, including:
- Addition of jobs.cancelled_at column
- Addition of jobs.storage_path column

Note: These are smoke tests to verify migration logic integrity and
that the new columns are present in the database models.
