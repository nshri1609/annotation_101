# 🐛 Video Annotator – macOS Testing Bug Report

This document consolidates user testing feedback from a macOS environment for the [Video Annotator](https://github.com/InfantLab/VideoAnnotator) project.
Each section below describes a reproducible issue, observed behaviour, and suggested next steps.

---

## 1. ⚠️ Permission Issues – Shell Config & `.config` Directory

**Summary:**
Installer cannot write to `~/.zshrc` or create `~/.config` due to root ownership, preventing path setup and config creation.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Run installer or launch backend from terminal.
2. Attempt to add `uv` to PATH or save edits to `.zshrc`.
3. Observe write failures or missing `.config` directory.

**Expected:**
Installer automatically creates or edits these files with correct permissions.

**Actual:**

- `~/.zshrc` and/or `~/.config` are owned by `root`.
- PATH not updated and installer fails silently.

**Suggested Fix:**

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER ~/.zshrc
chmod u+w ~/.zshrc
sudo chown -R $USER ~/.config
```

- Add permission check + warning in installer.
- Provide fallback to `.zprofile` if `.zshrc` missing.

## 2. 📦 NPM / Node.js Installation & Script Errors

**Summary:**
On fresh macOS setups, `npm` is not installed and the README suggests `npm start`, which is not a valid script.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to `video-annotation-viewer` and run `npm start`.
3. Observe: `zsh: command not found: npm` or “Missing script: start”.

**Expected:**

- Clear pre-check for Node.js / NPM presence.
- Correct instructions for starting the frontend.

**Actual:**

- `npm` not installed.
- Wrong script name (`npm run dev` is correct).

**Suggested Fix:**

- Add version check in installer:

```bash
node -v && npm -v
```

- Update docs:

```bash
cd video-annotation-viewer
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 3. 🪛 Missing Python Dependencies

**Summary:**
Backend fails due to missing modules (`lap`, `librosa`, `pycocotools`, `webvtt-py`, `pyannote.core`, `praatio`, `openai-whisper`).

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Install requirements with current instructions.
2. Run API server.
3. Observe `ModuleNotFoundError` messages.

**Expected:**
All core dependencies are installed automatically.

**Actual:**
Import errors occur during runtime.

**Suggested Fix:**

- Add missing dependencies to `requirements.txt` or a `requirements-extras.txt`.
- Provide a post-install validation step.

**Workaround Used:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install lap librosa pycocotools webvtt-py pyannote.core praatio openai-whisper
```

## 4. 🔊 Speaker Diarization Requires Hugging Face Token

**Summary:**
Audio pipeline fails to initialize without a Hugging Face auth token and terms acceptance for PyAnnote models.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Enable diarization in the pipeline.
2. Run audio processing.
3. Error: “HuggingFace token required for PyAnnote models”.

**Expected:**

- Clear prompt to set token or fallback behaviour if missing.

**Actual:**

- Pipeline fails immediately without guidance.

**Suggested Fix:**

- Add `.env` support for `HF_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- Check for token on startup and print instructions.

**Workaround:**

```bash
echo 'export HF_AUTH_TOKEN="your_token_here"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

## 5. 🧠 Speech Recognition Segfault (Apple Silicon)

**Summary:**
Speech recognition crashes with OpenMP errors on M1/M2 Macs.

**Error:**

```
OMP: Error #179: Function pthread_mutex_init failed
zsh: segmentation fault  python api_server.py
Speech recognition failed: No threading layer could be loaded.
```

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Run speech pipeline on Apple Silicon.
2. Observe OpenMP crash and segmentation fault.

**Expected:**

- Compatible threading backend or graceful failure.

**Actual:**

- Crash and abort due to missing `intel-openmp`.

**Suggested Fix:**

- Detect architecture and suggest installing Apple-compatible OpenMP:

```bash
brew install libomp
```

- Add pre-run environment validation.

## 6. 📤 API Results Not Downloaded

**Summary:**
Video processing completes, but no downloadable file is returned to the browser. Results appear only on the server filesystem.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Upload and process a video.
2. Wait for pipeline completion.
3. No download prompt or returned file.

**Expected:**
Results should be downloadable or a link should be displayed in the UI.

**Actual:**
Processing completes successfully, but the frontend never receives the output.

**Suggested Fix:**

- Ensure API endpoint returns correct headers:
  - `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`
  - `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="results.json"`
- Add download link or retry option to UI.
