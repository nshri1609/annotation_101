"""Audio processing pipelines for VideoAnnotator.

This module provides modular audio pipelines:
- AudioPipelineModular: Modular coordinator for multiple independent audio pipelines (recommended)
- SpeechPipeline: Speech recognition using OpenAI Whisper (inherits from BasePipeline)
- DiarizationPipeline: Speaker diarization using PyAnnote (inherits from BasePipeline)
- LAIONVoicePipeline: Voice emotion analysis using LAION Empathic Insight models (inherits from BasePipeline)
- WhisperBasePipeline: Base pipeline for Whisper-based audio processing tasks (inherits from BasePipeline)

For backwards compatibility, AudioPipelineModular is also available as AudioPipeline.
