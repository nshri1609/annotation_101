## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-04

### JOSS Review Version

This release accompanies the JOSS submission of VideoAnnotator and its companion project Video Annotation Viewer.

#### Changed

- **CLIP migration**: Migrated scene-classification pipeline from `clip` to `open_clip`, using the LAION-2B pretrained `ViT-B-32` model for improved availability and reproducibility.
- **HuggingFace auth**: Updated diarization and Whisper pipelines to use the current `token` parameter instead of the deprecated `use_auth_token`.
- **Devcontainer**: Simplified forwarded-port list to the single default API port (18011).

#### Fixed

- **Database GUID handling**: Added defensive `try/except` in the `GUID` type decorator to gracefully handle malformed UUID values.
- **Diarization init**: Wrapped model loading in explicit error handling with a clear log message on failure.

#### Removed

- **Voice emotion baseline**: Removed `voice_emotion_baseline` pipeline metadata and associated tests (superseded by LAION EmoNet voice pipeline).

#### Documentation

- Added JOSS cover letter (`paper/cover_letter.md`).
- Updated paper bibliography version to v1.4.2.

## [1.4.1] - 2025-12-26

### Release Quality, Docs, and Developer Experience

#### Added
- **Container/Devcontainer**: Baked `hadolint` into Docker images and devcontainer so pre-commit hooks work reliably.
- **Dockerfiles**: Added `git-lfs` to CPU/GPU Dockerfiles for smoother model/asset workflows.

#### Changed
- **Documentation**: Consolidated the JOSS manuscript into `paper/paper.md` and replaced `docs/joss.md` with a pointer to avoid divergence.
- **Repository Hygiene**: Moved top-level helper scripts into organized subfolders under `scripts/` and updated imports to the `videoannotator.*` package namespace.
- **Entrypoints**: Updated `api_server.py` to act as a compatibility wrapper; documentation now recommends using the `videoannotator` CLI.
- **README**: Rationalized repeated setup/install instructions, fixed broken/non-links, and replaced hard-coded test/coverage claims with CI status.

#### Fixed
- **Docs**: Standardized examples on the canonical API port `18011` and corrected Docker run port mappings.
- **Docs**: Replaced placeholder `docs/usage/accessing_results.md` with a real results retrieval guide.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-15

### Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the Video Annotation Viewer team for extensive integration testing that identified critical production issues addressed in this release.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-09-18

### Changed

- Uniform absolute import normalization across API, pipelines, storage, auth, exporters, and CLI to eliminate fragile `src.` and relative (`..`) paths after previous layout adjustments.
- CLI server invocation now targets `api.main:app` directly (removing stale `src.` reference) improving reliability of `videoannotator server`.
- Restored and merged accidentally truncated `docs/archive/development/roadmap_v1.3.0.md` content; added explicit "Package Layout Normalization" technical debt section without loss of prior feature timeline, risks, or metrics.
- Updated Windows console output in version/dependency reporting to ASCII-safe tags only (reinforcing earlier 1.2.1 patch policy) – ensured no reintroduction of emojis in modified modules.

### Added

- Status annotations in the v1.2.1 roadmap marking tasks as COMPLETED / DEFERRED / PARTIAL to synchronize roadmap with actual delivered scope.
- Explicit release date + version bump in `src/version.py` for 1.2.2.
- Technical debt narrative enumerating upcoming packaging namespace migration (planned for v1.3.0) and associated deprecation shim strategy.

### Fixed

- Server startup failure (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`) caused by inconsistent import paths after flattening; all runtime imports now resolvable when installed in editable or built form.
- Documentation integrity regression where large sections of v1.3.0 roadmap were temporarily overwritten; fully restored from history.

### Migration / Guidance

- No API surface changes. Downstream code referencing `src.` prefixes should be updated to plain absolute module imports (e.g. `from api.main import app`).
- Future v1.3.0 namespace migration will introduce `videoannotator.*` package paths; current absolute imports chosen to minimize churn (deprecation shims will map old paths temporarily).

### Internal / Tooling Notes

- Consolidated import approach reduces risk of duplicate module objects under mixed relative/absolute resolution, aiding forthcoming plugin/registry enhancements.
- Roadmap adjustments documented to prevent silent scope shrinkage in strategic planning artifacts.

### Testing / Validation

- Smoke import test: `import api.main, pipelines.base_pipeline, exporters.native_formats` succeeds post-normalization.
- API key optional validation behavior unchanged; 401 still returned only for explicitly invalid provided keys.

### Backward Compatibility

- Fully backward compatible at API & CLI command level; only internal import paths refactored. Any third-party code using undocumented relative imports must adjust.

### Rationale

- Establishes a clean, predictable import baseline before larger v1.3.0 restructuring (namespaced package, extras, plugin hooks) to reduce compounded technical debt.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-09-17

### Added

- Pipeline Registry: YAML-driven pipeline metadata under `src/registry/metadata/` dynamically exposed via `/api/v1/pipelines` (single source of truth).
- Extended Taxonomy Fields: `pipeline_family`, `variant`, `tasks`, `modalities`, `capabilities`, `backends`, optional `stability` replacing the former coarse `category` concept.
- Auto-generated Pipeline Specification: `docs/pipelines_spec.md` produced by `scripts/generate_pipeline_specs.py` (regenerate to update docs; diffs signal drift).
- Emotion Output Format Specification: Standard segment-based JSON schema at `docs/specs/emotion_output_format.md` for emotion-recognition task outputs.
- New Pipelines Registered: `face_openface3_embedding`, `face_laion_clip`, `voice_emotion_baseline` (with combined speech-transcription + emotion-recognition tasks).
- CLI Enhancements: `videoannotator pipelines` now supports `--json`, `--detailed`, and markdown table output.
- API Enhancements: `/api/v1/pipelines` and `/api/v1/pipelines/{name}` now return full metadata including `display_name` and all taxonomy arrays.
- Standard Error Envelope: Introduced `APIError` with consistent JSON structure (`error.code`, `error.message`, `error.hint`) across pipeline + job endpoints.
- Health Enrichment: `/api/v1/system/health` now includes pipeline count, capped name list, uptime_seconds, and explicit embedded job queue status.
- Error Handling Tests: Added unit test ensuring 404 pipeline detail uses standardized envelope.
- CLI Emotion Validation: Added `videoannotator validate-emotion` command for schema checking `.emotion.json` outputs.
- Output Naming Conventions Spec: Canonical file naming patterns documented at `docs/specs/output_naming_conventions.md` (frozen for v1.2.x).
- Emotion Validator Utility: Lightweight schema validator in `src/validation/emotion_validator.py` with tests ensuring emotion JSON conformance.

### Changed

- Deprecated Single `category` Field: Replaced by multi-dimensional taxonomy (no longer emitted in API; remove any downstream reliance on it).
- Documentation Alignment: README and release notes now direct users to `/api/v1/pipelines` and `docs/pipelines_spec.md` instead of hard-coded lists.
- Canonical Discovery: All pipeline listings and attributes should be consumed from the API or generated spec, not ad hoc YAML enumeration in user code.
- CLI Versioning: CLI now derives version from single source `src/version.py` (removed hardcoded API version strings).
- OpenFace 3.0 Import Safety: Converted eager OpenFace imports to lazy loading in `openface3_pipeline` to prevent argparse side-effects and enable test collection without OpenFace installed.

### Migration / Guidance

- If prior tooling referenced `category`, map logic to one or more of: `tasks`, `modalities`, or `pipeline_family` depending on intent.
- Update any scripts that enumerated pipelines manually to call: `videoannotator pipelines --json` for stable machine parsing.
- To regenerate the pipeline spec after adding/editing metadata: run the provided generation script (see header comments in `scripts/generate_pipeline_specs.py`).
- Emotion analysis consumers should validate outputs against the documented schema instead of reverse-engineering per-pipeline fields.

### Notes

- These changes prepare the groundwork for richer capability/resource descriptors planned for v1.3.0 without introducing breaking runtime behaviors in existing pipelines.
- All additions are backward compatible except for removal of the legacy `category` field; no other API contracts changed.

#### Patch Update (Light Stabilization - Auth & Logging)

Date: 2025-09-17 (post initial 1.2.1 feature merge)

Added:

- Optional legacy API key validation helper (`validate_optional_api_key`) enforcing 401 on explicitly invalid `va_` style keys while preserving anonymous access for endpoints that allowed it.

Changed:

- Replaced runtime and test console emojis with ASCII tags (`[OK]`, `[WARNING]`, `[ERROR]`) in `version.py`, `coco_validator.py`, person tracking pipeline logging, and integration test prints for Windows console compatibility.
- Injected conditional auth dependency into job endpoints (no behavior change for anonymous requests unless an invalid key is supplied).

Documentation:

- Appended "Technical Debt & Deferred Stabilization Items" section to `docs/archive/development/roadmap_v1.3.0.md` enumerating deferred heavier tasks (BatchStatus semantics, retry backoff policy, pipeline config defaults, synthetic video fixtures, storage lifecycle cleanup, Whisper CUDA fallback test adjustments, error envelope taxonomy, registry extensions, residual emoji cleanup, auth follow-up tests).

Testing / Validation:

- Targeted integration tests confirm: invalid API key now returns 401; anonymous job submission paths unaffected; no remaining emoji assumptions in modified tests.

Backward Compatibility:

- No breaking API changes; only invalid provided API keys now correctly rejected. Anonymous behavior unchanged where previously permitted.

Rationale:

- Scope intentionally limited to low-risk hardening and Windows-safe output formatting ahead of broader v1.3.0 feature work.

The v1.0.0 release introduces significant architectural changes. Here's how to migrate:

#### Configuration Changes

**Old (v0.x):**

```python
# Direct pipeline initialization
from src.processors.video_processor import VideoProcessor
processor = VideoProcessor(config_dict)
```

**New (v1.0.0):**

```python
# Modern pipeline architecture
from src.pipelines import SceneDetectionPipeline
pipeline = SceneDetectionPipeline(config)
```

#### API Changes

**Old:**

```python
# Direct method calls
results = processor.process_video(video_path)
```

**New:**

```python
# Standardized pipeline interface
results = pipeline.process(video_path, start_time=0, end_time=None)
```

#### Configuration Format

**Old:**

```python
# Python dictionary configuration
config = {
    'video_settings': {'fps': 30},
    'audio_settings': {'sample_rate': 16000}
}
```

**New:**

```yaml
# YAML configuration
video:
  fps: 30
audio:
  sample_rate: 16000
```

#### CLI Changes

**Old:**

```bash
python process_video.py --video video.mp4 --output output/
```

**New:**

```bash
python main.py --input video.mp4 --output output/ --config configs/default.yaml
```

### Breaking Changes

1. **Pipeline Architecture**: Complete rewrite of processing pipelines
2. **Configuration System**: Moved from Python dictionaries to YAML files
3. **CLI Interface**: New unified command-line interface
4. **Output Formats**: Standardized output schemas
5. **Dependencies**: Updated to modern ML libraries

### Deprecation Notices

- Legacy processor classes will be removed in v2.0.0
- Python dictionary configuration deprecated in favor of YAML
- Old CLI scripts will be removed in v2.0.0

### Upgrade Path

1. **Update Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Convert Configuration**: Use new YAML format
3. **Update Code**: Migrate to new pipeline architecture
4. **Test Integration**: Run comprehensive tests
5. **Update Documentation**: Review API changes
