# Jerry's Testing Feedback - Issue Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Tester:** Jerry
**Context:** Production readiness assessment for VideoAnnotator v1.2.x
**Scope:** Server-side issues affecting client integration and operational reliability

---

## Issue 1: Version Number Inconsistencies

**Issue:**

> `src/version.py` shows 1.2.2; `pyproject.toml` shows 1.2.1; health and CLI can drift.

**Source:** Server (VideoAnnotator backend)

**Analysis:**

- Multiple version sources create confusion for client detection
- Client relies on `/api/v1/system/health` which may report different version than actual codebase
- Version drift makes debugging difficult ("which version am I actually talking to?")

**Impact on Client:**

- Client's `detectServerInfo()` may get inconsistent version information
- Feature detection becomes unreliable
- QA testing needs to verify multiple version sources

**Recommended Action:**

1. **Server:** Implement single source of truth for version (e.g., `__version__` in `src/version.py`)
2. **Server:** Import version into all endpoints from single source
3. **Server:** Add `/api/v1/system/version` endpoint that returns all version metadata:
   ```json
   {
     "api_version": "1.2.2",
     "server_version": "1.2.2",
     "git_commit": "abc123",
     "build_date": "2025-10-09",
     "python_version": "3.11.5"
   }
   ```
4. **Client:** Update version detection to use new endpoint and log discrepancies

**Priority:** Medium (affects debugging and support)

---

## Issue 2: Validator Always Returns Valid

**Issue:**

> Validator always returns valid; CLI config `--validate` only checks syntax.

**Source:** Server (VideoAnnotator backend - validation logic)

**Analysis:**

- False sense of security - invalid configs pass validation
- Client submits jobs that will fail at runtime, not at submission time
- No semantic validation (e.g., checking if pipeline parameters are actually supported)

**Impact on Client:**

- Users see job submission succeed, then jobs fail mysteriously
- Poor UX - errors happen late in the process
- Client can't provide helpful validation feedback upfront

**Recommended Action:**

1. **Server:** Implement proper validation endpoint: `/api/v1/pipelines/{name}/validate`
   - Check parameter types, ranges, required fields
   - Validate pipeline combinations
   - Return detailed validation errors with field-level feedback
2. **Server:** Add validation to job submission (fail fast)
3. **Client:** Call validation before job submission
4. **Client:** Display validation errors inline in job creation form

**Priority:** High (affects user experience and data quality)

---

## Issue 3: Uploads Saved in Ephemeral Temp Dirs

**Issue:**

> Uploads saved in ephemeral temp dirs; risks data loss on restart/GC.

**Source:** Server (VideoAnnotator backend - file storage)

**Analysis:**

- Uploaded videos in `/tmp` or similar ephemeral locations
- Server restart = data loss
- Garbage collection may delete files while jobs are processing
- No persistent storage strategy

**Impact on Client:**

- Jobs fail mysteriously when files disappear
- Cannot retry failed jobs (file is gone)
- Users lose uploaded videos and need to re-upload

**Recommended Action:**

1. **Server:** Implement persistent storage directory (configurable via env var)
2. **Server:** Add job lifecycle management:
   - Keep files until job completes + retention period
   - Add cleanup endpoint: `/api/v1/jobs/{id}/cleanup`
   - Add storage monitoring/limits
3. **Server:** Document storage requirements in deployment guide
4. **Client:** Handle "file not found" errors gracefully
5. **Client:** Add warning if job is old and file may be cleaned up

**Priority:** Critical (data loss risk)

---

## Issue 4: /health Endpoint Lacks Context

**Issue:**

> `/health` lacks registry and GPU context; diagnostics require extra steps.

**Source:** Server (VideoAnnotator backend - health check endpoint)

**Analysis:**

- Basic health check doesn't expose operational status
- No information about available pipelines
- No GPU availability/utilization info
- Debugging requires multiple API calls

**Impact on Client:**

- Cannot determine if server is actually ready (vs just "alive")
- No way to show GPU availability in UI
- Cannot detect if pipelines are loaded and ready

**Recommended Action:**

1. **Server:** Enhance `/api/v1/system/health` with detailed status:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "api_version": "1.2.2",
     "server_version": "1.2.2",
     "pipelines_loaded": 6,
     "pipelines_ready": 6,
     "gpu": {
       "available": true,
       "devices": ["CUDA:0"],
       "memory_used_gb": 2.5,
       "memory_total_gb": 8.0
     },
     "storage": {
       "upload_dir": "/var/videoannotator/uploads",
       "free_gb": 150.2
     },
     "uptime_seconds": 86400
   }
   ```
2. **Client:** Use enhanced health info to show system status in UI
3. **Client:** Add "System Status" indicator with GPU and storage info

**Priority:** Medium (improves observability and user confidence)

## Issue 5: Permissive CORS and Optional Key

**Issue:**

> Permissive CORS and an optional key are fine locally but risky in labs.

**Source:** Server (VideoAnnotator backend - security configuration)

**Analysis:**

- Development defaults are insecure
- CORS allows any origin = CSRF risk
- Optional authentication = unauthorized access
- "Works on my machine" becomes "exposed to entire lab network"

**Impact on Client:**

- Client assumes authentication is enforced
- Security model unclear (is token required or not?)
- Deployment documentation doesn't emphasize security

**Recommended Action:**

1. **Server:** Make authentication required by default (opt-out for dev only)
2. **Server:** Restrict CORS to specific origins (env var: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`)
3. **Server:** Add security warnings to logs on startup if insecure mode is enabled
4. **Server:** Document security configuration prominently
5. **Client:** Add note in TokenSetup component about security requirements
6. **Documentation:** Add "Production Deployment Security Checklist"

**Priority:** High (security risk in shared environments)

---

## Issue 6: Delete Endpoint Cannot Stop In-Progress Jobs

**Issue:**

> Delete endpoint removes records but cannot stop in-progress processing; concurrency can OOM GPU.

**Source:** Server (VideoAnnotator backend - job lifecycle management)

**Analysis:**

- Delete is logical only (DB record), not physical (stop processing)
- Running GPU jobs continue consuming memory after "deletion"
- No concurrency control = multiple jobs can OOM the GPU
- Resource leak leads to server instability

**Impact on Client:**

- "Delete" button gives false sense of control
- Users cannot cancel runaway jobs
- Server crashes affect all users

**Recommended Action:**

1. **Server:** Implement job cancellation:
   - Add `CANCELLED` status to job state machine
   - Add `/api/v1/jobs/{id}/cancel` endpoint
   - Actually stop pipeline processing threads/processes
   - Clean up GPU memory on cancellation
2. **Server:** Add concurrency limits (max concurrent GPU jobs)
3. **Server:** Add queue system (jobs wait if GPU is busy)
4. **Client:** Change "Delete" to "Cancel" for running jobs
5. **Client:** Add "Job Queue" view showing position in queue

**Priority:** Critical (affects server stability and user control)

---

## Issue 7: Soft-Fail Loader Not Fully Tested

**Issue:**

> Soft-fail loader not fully tested against malformed YAML.

**Source:** Server (VideoAnnotator backend - configuration loading)

**Analysis:**

- Configuration loader may fail silently or with unclear errors
- Malformed YAML can cause unpredictable behavior
- Lack of test coverage for edge cases

**Impact on Client:**

- Job submission with malformed config may succeed but job fails
- Error messages unhelpful ("configuration error")
- Client cannot help user fix the issue

**Recommended Action:**

1. **Server:** Add comprehensive YAML validation tests
2. **Server:** Return detailed error messages for YAML parsing failures:
   ```json
   {
     "error": "YAML_PARSE_ERROR",
     "message": "Invalid YAML syntax",
     "line": 5,
     "column": 12,
     "detail": "Expected ',' but found '>'"
   }
   ```
3. **Server:** Document valid YAML schema with examples
4. **Client:** Add YAML syntax highlighting and validation in config editor
5. **Client:** Show parse errors inline with line numbers

**Priority:** Medium (improves reliability and UX)

---

## Issue 8: Mixed Examples (Legacy vs API-First)

**Issue:**

> Mixed examples (legacy direct pipeline use vs API-first). Reduces confusion and support churn.

**Source:** Both (documentation and code examples)

**Analysis:**

- Documentation shows two different usage patterns
- Users don't know which approach to follow
- Legacy examples don't use API best practices
- Increases support burden ("which way is right?")

**Impact on Client:**

- Client developers unsure how to integrate
- Examples may show deprecated patterns
- Inconsistent integration approaches

**Recommended Action:**

1. **Documentation:** Mark legacy examples as deprecated
2. **Documentation:** Create "API Integration Guide" with current best practices
3. **Documentation:** Add migration guide from legacy to API-first
4. **Server:** Add deprecation warnings to legacy endpoints
5. **Client:** Use only current API patterns in codebase
6. **Client:** Update `docs/CLIENT_SERVER_COLLABORATION_GUIDE.md` with clarity

**Priority:** Low (technical debt, affects onboarding)

---

## Issue 9: Inconsistent Error Handling

**Issue:**

> Mixed direct HTTPException and APIError usage; inconsistent error JSON. Clients rely on consistent envelopes with hints.

**Source:** Server (VideoAnnotator backend - error handling)

**Analysis:**

- Some endpoints return:
  ```json
  { "detail": "Error message" }
  ```
- Others return:
  ```json
  {
    "error": { "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "..." },
    "detail": "..."
  }
  ```
- Client must handle multiple error formats
- Cannot rely on error codes for programmatic handling

**Impact on Client:**

- Complex error handling logic in `src/api/handleError.ts`
- Cannot provide consistent error UX
- Cannot implement smart error recovery

**Recommended Action:**

1. **Server:** Standardize on single error format:
   ```json
   {
     "error": {
       "code": "ERROR_CODE",
       "message": "Human readable message",
       "detail": "Technical details",
       "field": "parameter_name", // for validation errors
       "retry_after": 60 // for rate limits
     },
     "request_id": "uuid"
   }
   ```
2. **Server:** Create custom exception handler that wraps all errors
3. **Server:** Document error codes in OpenAPI spec
4. **Client:** Simplify error handling to expect consistent format
5. **Client:** Add error code -> user message mapping

**Priority:** High (affects client robustness and UX)

---

## Issue 10: Mixed Logging Approaches

**Issue:**

> Some runtime prints outside logger; risk of Unicode in CLI prints.

**Source:** Server (VideoAnnotator backend - logging)

**Analysis:**

- Mix of `print()` and proper logging
- Unicode characters may break CLI output
- Inconsistent log levels and formatting
- Difficult to capture/redirect output properly

**Impact on Client:**

- Client cannot control server logging
- Cannot parse structured logs
- Deployment complexity (capturing stdout vs logs)

**Recommended Action:**

1. **Server:** Replace all `print()` with proper logger calls
2. **Server:** Use structured logging (JSON format option)
3. **Server:** Handle Unicode safely (encode/decode explicitly)
4. **Server:** Add log level configuration (env var: `LOG_LEVEL`)
5. **Documentation:** Document logging configuration for deployments

**Priority:** Low (operational quality of life)
