## 📋 v1.4.2 Deliverables - JOSS FOCUSED

### Phase 1: Quick Polish (Week 1)

Complete the minimal deferred items from v1.3.0 (16 hours total):

#### 1.1 Queue Position Display

- [ ] Add computed `queue_position` property for PENDING jobs
- [ ] Include in API responses
- [ ] Add tests
- **Effort**: 2 hours

**Acceptance criteria**:
- `queue_position` is 1-based and only set for `pending` jobs
- Ordering matches the worker dequeue order (FIFO by `created_at`)

#### 1.2 Deterministic Test Fixtures

- [ ] Synthetic video generator with known properties
- [ ] Mock OpenCV capture for unit tests
- [ ] Eliminate flaky tests
- **Effort**: 8 hours

**Acceptance criteria**:
- Tests stop relying on invalid “fake video bytes” and use deterministic, OpenCV-readable fixtures
- Default fixture avoids codec edge cases (prefer AVI/MJPG for broad OpenCV support)
- Verified by at least one targeted smoke run (e.g., `uv run pytest -q tests/pipelines/test_scene_detection.py::TestSceneDetectionPipeline::test_pipeline_initialization`)

#### 1.3 Documentation Touch-ups

- [ ] Enhance contributor workflow docs
- [ ] Expand troubleshooting based on feedback
