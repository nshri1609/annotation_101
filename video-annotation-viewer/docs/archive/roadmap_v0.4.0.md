# Video Annotation Viewer v0.4.0 - Feature Roadmap

> **⚠️ STATUS: SUPERSEDED**  
> **Released**: October 2025 (as part of v0.5.0)  
> This roadmap was superseded during development. The planned features evolved based on VideoAnnotator v1.3.0 server capabilities and user needs. Core monitoring and UX features were delivered, while enterprise features (bulk processing, visual config builder, landing page redesign) were deferred to v0.6.x. See [ROADMAP_v0.5.0.md](./ROADMAP_v0.5.0.md) for actual deliverables and [ROADMAP_v0.6.1.md](../development/ROADMAP_v0.6.1.md) for deferred features and the JOSS release plan.

  - [ ] TypeScript typecheck (tsc --noEmit) passes
  - [ ] ESLint passes (no error-level rules)

- Tests & Coverage
  - [ ] Vitest unit/integration tests pass on CI
  - [ ] Test coverage meets thresholds (proposed defaults):
        Lines ≥ 80%, Branches ≥ 70%, Functions ≥ 80%, Statements ≥ 80%
  - [ ] Codecov upload succeeds; coverage badge reflects latest main

- E2E & Cross-browser
  - [ ] Playwright smoke tests pass (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
  - [ ] Core flows: load demo, toggle overlays, seek/timeline, job list open
  - [ ] Pipeline discovery works against local VA server (1.2.x)

- Accessibility & Performance
  - [ ] Lighthouse CI: Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 90, Best Practices ≥ 90
  - [ ] Axe checks pass on key pages (no critical violations)

- Bundle & Security
  - [ ] Bundle size budgets respected (e.g., app chunk < 300KB gzip; vendor < 500KB)
  - [ ] npm audit (production) shows 0 high/critical vulnerabilities

  - [ ] Require up-to-date with base branch

Implementation notes (for later enablement):
- Coverage thresholds: set in `vitest.config.ts -> test.coverage.thresholds`.
- Codecov: repo connected; token only needed for private repos.
- Playwright: add `@playwright/test`, basic smoke specs, and GitHub Action.
- Lighthouse CI: add `@lhci/cli` with minimal config and CI step.
- Size budgets: add `size-limit` (or vite-plugin bundle analyzer) with CI step.
- Branch protection: configure in GitHub settings when RC branch is cut.
