# Feature Specification: VideoAnnotator v1.3.0 Production Reliability & Critical Fixes

**Feature Branch**: `001-videoannotator-v1-3`
**Created**: October 11, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "VideoAnnotator v1.3.0 Production Reliability & Critical Fixes Release"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Upload Video Without Data Loss (Priority: P1)

As a researcher, I need to upload a video file for processing and be confident that my video and results will persist even if the server restarts, so I don't lose hours of processing work and can retry failed jobs.

**Why this priority**: CRITICAL - Data loss blocks production use entirely. Researchers cannot trust the system if their work disappears on server restart.

**Independent Test**: Upload a video, restart the server, verify video and job metadata still accessible. Delivers core persistence guarantee.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I upload a 500MB video file, **When** the server restarts before processing completes, **Then** the video file is still available and job can resume or be retried
2. **Given** I have completed jobs with results, **When** the server restarts, **Then** all results remain downloadable
3. **Given** I configure a custom storage directory, **When** I upload videos, **Then** they are stored in my configured location (not /tmp)
4. **Given** the storage directory doesn't exist, **When** the server starts, **Then** it creates the directory structure automatically

---

### User Story 2 - Stop Runaway Jobs (Priority: P1)

As a lab administrator, I need to cancel running GPU jobs that are stuck or consuming too many resources, so I can prevent server crashes and free up resources for other researchers.

**Why this priority**: CRITICAL - Prevents GPU OOM crashes and enables resource management in shared lab environments.

**Independent Test**: Start a GPU job, cancel it mid-processing, verify GPU memory is released. Delivers core job control capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a job is running on GPU, **When** I cancel it via the API, **Then** processing stops within 5 seconds and GPU memory is released
2. **Given** I delete a job that is queued but not started, **When** the deletion completes, **Then** the job never starts processing
3. **Given** I cancel a job with multiple pipelines, **When** cancellation is requested, **Then** all pipeline processes are terminated
4. **Given** a cancelled job, **When** I check its status, **Then** it shows "CANCELLED" status with cancellation timestamp

---

### User Story 3 - Submit Jobs with Valid Configurations (Priority: P1)

As a researcher, I need to know immediately if my configuration is invalid before submitting a job, so I don't waste time waiting for a job to fail late in processing.

**Why this priority**: CRITICAL - Poor UX blocks adoption. Invalid configs currently pass validation and fail cryptically at runtime.

**Independent Test**: Submit configs with missing required fields, invalid values, and valid configs. Verify immediate, clear feedback. Delivers core validation capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I submit a config with an invalid pipeline name, **When** I submit the job, **Then** I receive immediate error with list of valid pipeline names
2. **Given** I submit a config missing required fields, **When** validation runs, **Then** I receive field-level errors specifying which fields are missing
3. **Given** I submit a config with invalid field values, **When** validation runs, **Then** I receive error with valid value ranges or options
4. **Given** I have a complex config, **When** I use the validation endpoint before submission, **Then** I receive detailed validation results without submitting the job

---

### User Story 4 - Work in Secure Lab Environment (Priority: P2)

As a lab administrator, I need authentication enabled by default and CORS restricted to known origins, so unauthorized users cannot access our research data or consume our GPU resources.

**Why this priority**: HIGH - Security is essential for shared lab environments and multi-user scenarios, but doesn't block single-user research workflows.

**Independent Test**: Try to access API without credentials, verify rejection. Configure allowed origins, verify CORS enforcement. Delivers core security posture.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh server installation, **When** I start the server, **Then** authentication is required by default (no anonymous access)
2. **Given** CORS is configured for specific origins, **When** a request comes from unauthorized origin, **Then** the request is blocked
3. **Given** I need to disable auth for local development, **When** I set VIDEOANNOTATOR_REQUIRE_AUTH=false, **Then** server logs prominent security warning
4. **Given** I configure multiple allowed origins, **When** requests come from those origins, **Then** all are accepted with proper CORS headers

---

### User Story 5 - Understand API Errors Consistently (Priority: P2)

As a frontend developer integrating with VideoAnnotator, I need all API errors to follow the same format, so my error handling code works reliably across all endpoints.

**Why this priority**: HIGH - Enables reliable client integration. Currently forces clients to handle multiple error patterns, but doesn't block basic usage.

**Independent Test**: Trigger errors from different endpoints (404, 400, 500), verify all use standard envelope format. Delivers consistent error contract.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I request a non-existent job, **When** the API responds, **Then** the error follows standard envelope format with error code, message, and hint
2. **Given** I submit invalid data, **When** validation fails, **Then** the error includes field-level detail in standard format
3. **Given** the server encounters an internal error, **When** the error is returned, **Then** it includes error code, timestamp, and reference for support
4. **Given** I integrate with multiple endpoints, **When** errors occur, **Then** my single error parser handles all responses

---

### User Story 6 - Import Package with Standard Namespace (Priority: P3)

As a developer extending VideoAnnotator, I need to import from a standard package namespace (e.g., `from videoannotator.pipelines`), so my code follows Python conventions and doesn't break on updates.

**Why this priority**: MEDIUM - Technical debt that improves maintainability but doesn't affect end-user functionality. Can be deferred if timeline pressures exist.

**Independent Test**: Import from `videoannotator.*` namespace, verify old `src.*` imports show deprecation warnings. Delivers namespace normalization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I install VideoAnnotator as a package, **When** I import `from videoannotator.pipelines`, **Then** the import succeeds without errors
2. **Given** I have legacy code using `from src.pipelines`, **When** I run it, **Then** it works but logs a deprecation warning
3. **Given** I install VideoAnnotator in editable mode, **When** I import the package, **Then** behavior matches wheel installation
4. **Given** I follow the migration guide, **When** I update my imports, **Then** migration completes in under 30 minutes

---

### User Story 7 - Submit Software for JOSS Publication (Priority: P1)

As a project maintainer, I need VideoAnnotator to meet JOSS review criteria (installation verification, comprehensive API docs, test coverage), so reviewers can successfully evaluate and approve our software paper submission.

**Why this priority**: CRITICAL - JOSS publication is release goal; reviewer friction blocks acceptance. All requirements must be verifiable by external reviewers.

**Independent Test**: External reviewer follows README to install, run tests, and execute sample pipeline. Completes JOSS checklist without clarification requests. Delivers publication-ready quality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reviewer runs `scripts/verify_installation.py`, **When** installation is correct, **Then** script validates dependencies and runs sample pipeline successfully
2. **Given** a reviewer examines API documentation, **When** checking endpoint documentation, **Then** all endpoints have docstrings with curl examples
3. **Given** a reviewer runs test suite, **When** executing `uv run pytest`, **Then** tests pass with >80% coverage for core pipelines
4. **Given** a reviewer follows troubleshooting guide, **When** encountering common issues, **Then** guide provides actionable solutions

---

### User Story 8 - Navigate Documentation as New Contributor (Priority: P2)

As an open-source contributor, I need clearly organized documentation that separates user guides, contributor guides, and troubleshooting, so I can quickly find relevant information without reading everything.

**Why this priority**: HIGH - Good documentation accelerates community contributions and reduces maintainer support burden, but doesn't block basic usage.

**Independent Test**: New contributor submits first PR within 2 hours using only CONTRIBUTING.md guidance. Delivers contributor-friendly documentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to fix a bug, **When** I read CONTRIBUTING.md, **Then** I can set up dev environment, run tests, and create PR without external help
2. **Given** I encounter an installation error, **When** I check troubleshooting guide, **Then** I find my specific error with clear resolution steps
3. **Given** I want to understand VideoAnnotator's architecture, **When** I browse docs/, **Then** I can navigate from high-level overview to detailed API references
4. **Given** I'm a JOSS reviewer, **When** I use "Getting Started for Reviewers" guide, **Then** I can verify all review checklist items in under 30 minutes

**Independent Test**: Install package, import from `videoannotator.*` namespace, verify all modules accessible. Delivers standard Python package structure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I install VideoAnnotator as a package, **When** I import `from videoannotator.pipelines`, **Then** the import succeeds
2. **Given** I have code using old `src.pipelines` imports, **When** I upgrade to v1.3.0, **Then** I see deprecation warnings but code still works
3. **Given** I follow migration guide, **When** I update imports to new namespace, **Then** deprecation warnings disappear
4. **Given** I install via wheel or editable mode, **When** I import modules, **Then** behavior is identical

- Data loss prevention and persistence guarantees
- Job lifecycle management (cancellation, queuing, state transitions)
- Configuration validation with clear error messages
- Secure-by-default configuration
- Standardized error response format
- Package namespace normalization
- Test infrastructure improvements for reliability
- **JOSS publication readiness**: installation verification, API documentation, test coverage validation
- **Documentation spring cleaning**: reorganization for external users, troubleshooting guides, contributor clarity
- **Script consolidation**: migrate essential tests, remove outdated scripts, create diagnostic tools

### Out of Scope (Deferred to v1.4.0+)

- Advanced features: active learning, quality assessment, multi-modal correlation
- Plugin system architecture
- Real-time streaming capabilities
- GraphQL API
- Enhanced health endpoint (detailed GPU stats, performance metrics)
- Version info endpoint
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Enterprise features (SSO, RBAC, multi-tenancy, audit logs)
- Cloud provider integration
- Microservice decomposition

## Assumptions *(include if applicable)*

1. **Infrastructure**: Server runs on Linux with GPU support optional but recommended for production
2. **Storage**: Persistent storage is on reliable filesystem (not network-mounted unless specifically configured for low latency)
3. **Concurrent Users**: Typical lab environment has 5-20 concurrent researchers, not thousands
4. **Job Duration**: Most jobs complete within 5-60 minutes (not multi-hour processing)
5. **Disk Space**: Storage directory has sufficient space for typical research workflows (100GB+ recommended)
6. **Authentication**: When enabled, assumes external authentication mechanism provides user tokens (JWT or API keys)
7. **CORS**: Production deployments use known frontend origins that can be configured at startup
8. **Migration**: Users upgrading from v1.2.x have 2-4 hour maintenance window for testing
9. **GPU Memory**: GPU jobs need 4-8GB VRAM; concurrent limit prevents exhaustion
10. **Python Version**: Python 3.10+ with uv package manager for dependency resolution

## Dependencies *(include if applicable)*

### Technical Dependencies

- Python 3.10+ runtime environment
- uv package manager for dependency resolution
- FastAPI framework (existing, version unchanged)
- SQLAlchemy for database operations (existing)
- GPU drivers (NVIDIA CUDA) for GPU-accelerated pipelines (optional)

### External Dependencies

- Client integration: Video Annotation Viewer v0.4.0+ (coordinated release)
- Documentation: Migration guide must be ready before release
- Testing: Client team QA sign-off required

### Breaking Changes

- Authentication now required by default (can be disabled via env var)
- Import paths change from `src.*` to `videoannotator.*` (deprecation shims provided)
- CORS restricted by default (must configure allowed origins)
- Error response format changes (standard envelope replaces ad-hoc formats)

## Risks & Mitigations *(include if applicable)*

### Risk 1: Storage Migration Breaks Existing Deployments

**Impact**: HIGH - Users with existing jobs could lose data during upgrade
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM - Migration path not yet tested with production data
**Mitigation**:
- Provide automated migration script that moves `/tmp` files to persistent storage
- Document backup procedure before upgrade
- Test migration with realistic data volumes
- Include rollback procedure in release notes

### Risk 2: Job Cancellation Doesn't Release GPU Memory

**Impact**: HIGH - GPU OOM crashes continue, defeats purpose of feature
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM - Complex signal handling and process lifecycle management
**Mitigation**:
- Test cancellation with all pipeline types
- Add monitoring for GPU memory usage before/after cancellation
- Include fallback to force-kill if graceful shutdown fails
- Document known limitations with specific pipelines

### Risk 3: Config Validation Performance Impact

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Job submission latency could exceed 200ms target
**Likelihood**: LOW - Validation is synchronous schema check
**Mitigation**:
- Benchmark validation with complex configs
- Cache schema validation rules
- Optimize validation logic for common patterns
- Consider async validation for very large configs

### Risk 4: Breaking Changes Block Urgent Upgrades

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Users with existing integrations must update code to upgrade
**Likelihood**: HIGH - Authentication and error format changes are breaking
**Mitigation**:
- Provide deprecation shims for import paths
- Document all breaking changes with migration examples
- Maintain v1.2.x security patches for 90 days
- Offer migration support office hours

### Risk 5: Timeline Slippage Due to Scope Creep

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Delayed release affects client team timeline
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM - Temptation to add "just one more fix"
**Mitigation**:
- Strict scope enforcement (only critical fixes)
- Weekly progress reviews with stakeholders
- Defer non-critical items to v1.4.0 backlog
- Maintain "deferred features" list in roadmap

## Clarifications Resolved

### Question 1: Storage Cleanup Strategy

**Decision**: **Option B - Automatic scheduled cleanup, disabled by default (opt-in via env var)**

**Rationale**: Conservative approach for research data - users maintain full control over when cleanup occurs. Can be enabled via `STORAGE_RETENTION_DAYS=30` when needed. Prevents accidental data loss while still providing cleanup capability for production deployments.

---

### Question 2: Job Cancellation During Multi-Pipeline Processing

**Decision**: **Option A - Immediate termination of all pipelines (in-progress and queued)**

**Rationale**: Simplest implementation with fastest response time (2-5 seconds). Primary goal is GPU memory release, which this achieves immediately. Users who need partial results can monitor job progress and cancel strategically. Reduces implementation complexity and ships faster.

---

### Question 3: Authentication Default Behavior

**Decision**: **Option A - Hard default: Auth required unless explicitly disabled (breaking change acceptable)**

**Rationale**: With minimal existing user base, can establish secure-by-default posture from the start. Sets correct precedent for future users. Development use remains easy with `VIDEOANNOTATOR_REQUIRE_AUTH=false`. Avoids "we'll fix security later" technical debt.

## Notes

- This specification covers a full minor release (v1.3.0) rather than a single feature, so scope is intentionally broad but strictly limited to critical fixes
- Timeline is aggressive (6-8 weeks) due to production deployment blocker issues AND coordinated JOSS publication
- Client team (Video Annotation Viewer) is coordinating their v0.5.0 release with our v1.3.0
- JOSS submission planned immediately after v1.3.0 release (targeting concurrent announcement)
- Documentation and script cleanup (FR-059 to FR-070) are "spring cleaning" tasks that remove technical debt and improve external contributor experience
- All advanced features (plugins, ML enhancements, enterprise capabilities) are explicitly deferred to v1.4.0+
- Test infrastructure improvements are included as P3 to prevent ongoing flaky test issues
- JOSS readiness requirements (FR-054 to FR-058) are P1 because they are release blockers for publication
