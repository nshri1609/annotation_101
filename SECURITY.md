Instead, please email us directly:

- **Email**: [infantologist@gmail.com](mailto:infantologist@gmail.com)
- **Subject**: `[VideoAnnotator Security] Brief description of vulnerability`

### 📋 What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
4. **Environment**: Operating system, Python version, dependencies
5. **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include minimal PoC code
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for mitigation

### 🕐 Response Timeline

We commit to:

- **Acknowledge** your report within **48 hours**
- **Provide initial assessment** within **1 week**
- **Coordinate disclosure** timeline based on severity
- **Credit researchers** in security advisories (if desired)

### 🛡️ Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private coordination** on fix development
2. **Public disclosure** after patch is available
3. **Security advisory** published with details
4. **CVE assignment** for qualifying vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 🔒 Environment Security

```bash
# Use virtual environments
conda create -n videoannotator python=3.12
conda activate videoannotator

# Keep dependencies updated
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

#### 📁 File Handling

- **Validate input files** before processing
- **Sanitize file paths** to prevent directory traversal
- **Limit file sizes** to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Use temporary directories** for processing

#### 🌐 Network Security

- **Avoid processing untrusted videos** from unknown sources
- **Use HTTPS** for model downloads
- **Verify checksums** of downloaded models
- **Isolate network access** in production environments

#### 🔑 Access Control

- **Run with minimal privileges** - don't use root/admin
- **Restrict file system access** to necessary directories
- **Use container isolation** in production deployments
- **Regular security updates** for system packages

### For Developers

#### 🛡️ Secure Coding

```python
# Input validation
def validate_video_path(path: str) -> Path:
    path = Path(path).resolve()
    if not path.exists():
        raise ValueError("Video file does not exist")
    if path.suffix.lower() not in ['.mp4', '.avi', '.mov']:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported video format")
    return path

# Secure temporary files
import tempfile
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=True) as tmp:
    # Process safely
    pass
```

#### 🔍 Dependency Management

- **Pin dependency versions** in requirements.txt
- **Regular security scans** with `pip-audit`
- **Monitor vulnerability databases** (GitHub Security Advisories)
- **Use dependabot** for automated security updates

#### 📊 Logging and Monitoring

- **Sanitize logs** - don't log sensitive paths/data
- **Monitor resource usage** - detect anomalous behavior
- **Rate limiting** for API endpoints
- **Input size limits** to prevent DoS

## Known Security Considerations

### 🎥 Video Processing

- **Large file handling**: Videos can consume significant memory/disk
- **Format vulnerabilities**: Some video codecs have known exploits
- **Metadata exposure**: Video files may contain sensitive metadata

### 🤖 ML Model Security

- **Model poisoning**: Use trusted model sources only
- **Adversarial inputs**: Malicious videos could exploit model vulnerabilities
- **Data privacy**: Models may memorize training data

### 🔗 Dependencies

- **Third-party libraries**: Regular updates required for security patches
- **Native dependencies**: FFmpeg, OpenCV may have vulnerabilities
- **GPU drivers**: CUDA/ROCm security considerations

## Incident Response

### 🚨 If You Suspect a Breach

1. **Immediately isolate** affected systems
2. **Document** the incident with timestamps
3. **Contact** our security team
4. **Preserve evidence** for analysis
5. **Update** to latest secure version

### 📋 Post-Incident

1. **Root cause analysis** to prevent recurrence
2. **Security patches** released promptly
3. **Public disclosure** after mitigation
4. **Process improvements** based on lessons learned

## Compliance and Standards

VideoAnnotator aims to comply with:

- **OWASP Top 10** security risks mitigation
- **ISO 27001** information security standards
- **GDPR/Privacy** considerations for video data
- **Research ethics** for academic use cases
